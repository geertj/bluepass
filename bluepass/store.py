class Store(object):
    """A simple JSON document store based on SQLite.

    The purpose of this class is to faciliate storing and retrieving JSON
    documents in SQLite. It specifically is not an ORM, and the fact that an
    SQL database is used internally intentionally leaks through in numerous
    places in the API. SQL is an excellent DSL for data access and there is no
    need to put something else on top. For example, the *where* argument to
    :meth:`findone` is a straight SQL WHERE clause.

    The store exposes zero or more collections, where each collection is a
    named set of documents. At the SQL level, a collection is a table with the
    same name as the collection. The table contains a column named doc that
    contains the JSON document as a string.

    Collections can have an indices on values in the documents that are
    addressed by a path. The indexed values are stored in a separate column
    named after the path as _path_. In case a path does not exist in a
    document, NULL is stored. A path is of the format "$part1$part2..." where
    each part addresses a key in a JSON object (positional access inside a JSON
    array is not currently supported).

    In most cases, the document level API i.e. :meth:`insert`, :meth:`update`
    and :meth:`delete` should be used. These methods automatically serialize
    and de-serialize the JSON, and handle the indices transparently.

    There are cases however in which using the document level API would be
    inefficient, for example, when you need GROUP BY or aggregate functions
    like MAX. For these cases, the :meth:`execute` method is available that
    allows you to execute a direct SQL query. Note however that when using this
    method you need to serialize and de-serialize the JSON yourself, and you
    also need to deal with indexes manually.
